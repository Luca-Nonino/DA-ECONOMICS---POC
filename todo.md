In this session,  I want you to make several adjusments to our frontend code, which is in the single file bellow.

Buttons
1- Remove the Json Button
2- Stack the buttons on top of each of other, with Check for New release bellow

Visual Feedbacking between button trigger and popup
1- add a loading indicator while the popup does not show up
2- block the screen with the gray overlay while the llm is running so the user trigger other actions

Release Date exibition.
1- add a Release Date: text next to the dropdown
2- the date is used in the backend as YYYYMMDD and is being presented as such, but we need as YYYY/MM/DD in the frontend

Styling
1- change the plain black and plain white to a almost white/black tone for better contrast
2- in the dark theme, the input text boxes for the prompt container should be black with white text.

Adjust all and give me the full code.
