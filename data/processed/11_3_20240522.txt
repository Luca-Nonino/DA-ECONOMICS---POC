**Macro Environment Impacts:**
||The June 2024 existing-home sales report indicates a notable shift in the housing market, transitioning from a seller's market to a more balanced environment. The 5.4% decline in sales volume, coupled with a record median price, suggests that while demand remains, affordability issues may be constraining buyer activity. The increase in inventory to a 4.1-month supply indicates that sellers are facing longer selling times and fewer offers, which could lead to a stabilization in prices moving forward. According to the Taylor Rule, the Federal Reserve may need to consider these housing market dynamics when formulating monetary policy. The persistent high median prices, alongside rising inventory, could influence inflation expectations and necessitate a cautious approach to interest rate adjustments. The mixed signals from the housing market—declining sales but rising prices—highlight the complexities the Fed faces in balancing economic growth with inflation control. As the market adjusts, monitoring these trends will be crucial for anticipating future policy shifts.||
