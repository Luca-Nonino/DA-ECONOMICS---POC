**Macro Environment Impacts:**
||The July 2024 existing-home sales report indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook for the housing market, as the 1.3% increase in sales suggests a potential stabilization after a prolonged decline. The year-over-year decrease of 2.5% highlights ongoing challenges, particularly in affordability and inventory constraints. The median price increase of 4.2% may exert upward pressure on inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to consider these dynamics in its monetary policy decisions. According to the Taylor Rule, the Fed may need to balance the need for economic growth against inflationary pressures stemming from rising home prices. The slight increase in inventory could provide some relief to buyers, but the 4.0-month supply still indicates a tight market. The stability in first-time buyer participation suggests that while affordability remains a concern, there is still demand in the market. Overall, these indicators will be crucial for shaping future monetary policy and housing market strategies.||
