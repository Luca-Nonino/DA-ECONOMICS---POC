**Title:**
{'US Leading Economic Index® (LEI) Fell Again in May'}

**Overview:**
||The report from The Conference Board highlights the performance of the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) for May 2024, which decreased by 0.5% to 101.2, following a 0.6% decline in April. Over the six-month period from November 2023 to May 2024, the LEI fell by 2.0%, a smaller decrease compared to the previous six months' 3.4% contraction. The decline was driven by reduced new orders, weak consumer sentiment, and lower building permits. Despite the negative growth rate, the LEI does not currently signal a recession. The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) rose by 0.4% to 112.4, indicating improvements in payroll employment, personal income, manufacturing and trade sales, and industrial production. The Lagging Economic Index (LAG) slightly decreased by 0.1% to 119.4.||

**Key Takeaways:**
- {**LEI Decline**}: [The Leading Economic Index (LEI) for the US decreased by 0.5% in May 2024 to 101.2, following a 0.6% decline in April. Over the six months ending in May, the LEI fell by 2.0%, a smaller decrease compared to the 3.4% contraction in the previous six months.]
- {**Drivers of LEI Decline**}: [The decline in the LEI was primarily driven by a reduction in new orders, weak consumer sentiment about future business conditions, and lower building permits.]
- {**GDP Growth Projection**}: [The Conference Board projects real GDP growth to slow to under 1% annualized over Q2 and Q3 2024 due to elevated inflation and high interest rates impacting consumer spending.]
- {**CEI Increase**}: [The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) rose by 0.4% in May 2024 to 112.4, with all four components—payroll employment, personal income less transfer payments, manufacturing and trade sales, and industrial production—showing improvement.]
- {**LAG Slight Decrease**}: [The Lagging Economic Index (LAG) inched down by 0.1% in May 2024 to 119.4, with its six-month growth rate softening to 0.7% from 0.8% in the previous six months.]
- {**3Ds Rule**}: [The LEI's six-month growth rate remained negative but trended less downward, not signaling a recession. The 3Ds rule—duration, depth, and diffusion—indicates that the diffusion index is below 50, suggesting most components are weakening, but the LEI's decline is not yet severe enough to signal an imminent recession.]

**Macro Environment Impacts**
||The data from the LEI, CEI, and LAG indices provide a comprehensive view of the current and future state of the US economy. The continued decline in the LEI, driven by reduced new orders, weak consumer sentiment, and lower building permits, suggests caution in economic outlooks. According to the Taylor Rule, the Federal Reserve may need to consider these indicators when adjusting monetary policy. The projected slowdown in GDP growth to under 1% annualized in Q2 and Q3 2024, coupled with elevated inflation and high interest rates, indicates a challenging environment for consumer spending. The CEI's rise, reflecting improvements in payroll employment and industrial production, provides some positive signals, but the overall economic landscape remains complex. The slight decrease in the LAG index further underscores the need for careful monitoring of economic conditions. Policymakers should balance between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth, potentially maintaining or slightly adjusting interest rates to navigate these mixed signals.||
