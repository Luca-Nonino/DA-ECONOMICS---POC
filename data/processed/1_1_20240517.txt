**Title:**
{'US Leading Economic Index® (LEI) Continued to Fall in April 2024'}

**Overview:**
||The report provides an analysis of the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) for April 2024, highlighting a 0.6% decline to 101.8, following a 0.3% decrease in March. Over the six-month period from October 2023 to April 2024, the LEI contracted by 1.9%, a smaller decrease compared to the previous six months' 3.5% decline. The report attributes the April decline to deteriorating consumer outlook, weaker new orders, a negative yield spread, and a drop in new building permits. Despite these declines, the LEI's six-month and annual growth rates no longer signal an imminent recession but indicate significant headwinds to growth. The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) rose by 0.2% in April, reflecting improvements in payroll employment, personal income less transfer payments, manufacturing and trade sales, and industrial production. The Lagging Economic Index (LAG) increased by 0.4% in April, showing a 1.1% rise over the past six months.||

**Key Takeaways:**
- {**LEI Decline**}: [The Leading Economic Index (LEI) for the US decreased by 0.6% in April 2024 to 101.8, following a 0.3% decline in March. Over the six months from October 2023 to April 2024, the LEI contracted by 1.9%, compared to a 3.5% decline in the previous six months.]
- {**Consumer Sentiment and New Orders**}: [The April decline in the LEI was driven by a deterioration in consumer outlook on business conditions, weaker new orders, a negative yield spread, and a drop in new building permits. Stock prices also contributed negatively for the first time since October of the previous year.]
- {**CEI Increase**}: [The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) rose by 0.2% in April 2024 to 112.3, after a similar increase in March. The CEI was up 0.9% over the six months ending April 2024, slightly ahead of its 0.8% increase over the previous six months. All four components of the CEI—payroll employment, personal income less transfer payments, manufacturing and trade sales, and industrial production—improved last month.]
- {**LAG Increase**}: [The Lagging Economic Index (LAG) increased by 0.4% in April 2024 to 119.5, after remaining unchanged in March. The LAG was up by 1.1% over the six months from October 2023 to April 2024, a substantial improvement from the 0.3% increase over the previous six months.]
- {**Economic Outlook**}: [Despite the LEI's decline, its six-month and annual growth rates no longer signal a forthcoming recession. However, elevated inflation, high interest rates, rising household debt, and depleted pandemic savings are expected to continue weighing on the US economy in 2024. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to under 1% over Q2 to Q3 2024.]

**Macro Environment Impacts:**
||The April 2024 decline in the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) underscores the challenges facing the US economy, with significant headwinds anticipated in the near term. The deterioration in consumer sentiment, weaker new orders, and a negative yield spread are critical indicators of softer economic conditions ahead. According to the Taylor Rule, the Federal Reserve may need to consider these mixed signals when adjusting monetary policy. The LEI's contraction, albeit less severe than in previous months, suggests that while an imminent recession may not be on the horizon, the economy is likely to experience sluggish growth. The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) and Lagging Economic Index (LAG) provide a more stable outlook, with incremental improvements in key economic indicators such as payroll employment and personal income. These mixed signals necessitate a cautious approach to monetary policy, balancing the need to control inflation with the imperative to support economic growth. The projected slowdown in real GDP growth to under 1% over Q2 to Q3 2024 further emphasizes the need for strategic policy adjustments to navigate the anticipated economic headwinds.||
