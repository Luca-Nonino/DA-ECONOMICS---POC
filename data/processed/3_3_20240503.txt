{'Sources of Economic News and Information for Consumers: May 3, 2024'}

**Overview:**
||This report from the University of Michigan explores the various sources from which consumers obtain economic information and how these sources influence their economic sentiment. The report is based on responses from 2,409 participants between January and April 2024. It highlights the prevalence of mainstream news, general/other news, and non-social media internet sources as the most frequently cited information sources. The report also delves into the relationship between the favorability of news heard and consumer sentiment, noting significant partisan differences in news source preferences and sentiment levels. Additionally, it examines demographic variations in information source preferences, revealing that younger, lower-income, and less-educated consumers are more likely to rely on social media and personal experiences for economic information.||

**Key Takeaways:**
- {**Prevalence of Information Sources**}: [Mainstream news, general/other news, and non-social media internet sources were the most frequently cited sources of economic information, each mentioned by over 30% of consumers. Word-of-mouth sources were cited by 20%, business news by 18%, and partisan news by 15%. Social media was mentioned by 13%, while fewer than 10% of consumers cited the stock market or personal experiences.]
- {**Sentiment and Favorability**}: [Consumers citing mainstream and business news sources reported the highest levels of economic sentiment and favorability of news heard. Conversely, those relying on personal experiences and word-of-mouth reported the least favorable news and lowest sentiment levels.]
- {**Partisan Differences**}: [Partisan news sources exhibited divergent trends in sentiment: Republicans reported lower sentiment and more negative news, while Democrats and Independents reported higher sentiment and more positive news. Mainstream news sources showed the largest partisan differences, with 50% of Democrats, 27% of Independents, and only 16% of Republicans mentioning them.]
- {**Demographic Variations**}: [Consumers citing social media were the youngest (average age 36), lower-income (median income $80,000), and less-educated (41% with a college degree). Those relying on personal experiences were also lower-income and less likely to have a college degree, reflecting more vulnerable financial circumstances.]

**Macro Environment Impacts**
||The report underscores the significant role that information sources play in shaping consumer sentiment and economic outlook. The high reliance on mainstream and business news among consumers with more favorable economic views suggests that these sources may contribute to a more optimistic economic sentiment. Conversely, the lower sentiment among those relying on personal experiences and word-of-mouth highlights the potential for economic vulnerability among these groups.

From a macroeconomic policy perspective, these findings suggest that consumer sentiment can be heavily influenced by the type of information consumed. According to the Taylor Rule, which guides monetary policy adjustments based on economic conditions, the Federal Reserve may need to consider the varying levels of consumer sentiment when making policy decisions. For instance, the higher sentiment among consumers following mainstream and business news could indicate a more robust economic outlook, potentially supporting a tighter monetary policy stance. On the other hand, the lower sentiment among those relying on personal experiences may signal underlying economic weaknesses that could warrant a more accommodative policy approach.

Overall, the report highlights the importance of understanding the sources of economic information and their impact on consumer sentiment, which can provide valuable insights for formulating effective macroeconomic strategies and policy adjustments.||
