**Title:**
{'The Conference Board Leading Economic Index¬Æ (LEI) for the U.S.: June 2024'}

**Overview:**
||The report presents the latest data on the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) for June 2024, highlighting a slight decline of 0.2% to 101.1. This follows a 0.4% decline in May. Over the first half of 2024, the LEI fell by 1.9%, a smaller decrease compared to the 2.9% contraction in the second half of 2023. The report attributes the decline to negative consumer expectations, weak new orders, a negative interest rate spread, and increased initial unemployment claims. Despite the decline, the LEI's long-term growth has become less negative, suggesting a slow recovery. The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) rose by 0.3% to 112.6, indicating current economic conditions, while the Lagging Economic Index (LAG) inched up by 0.1% to 119.5.||

**Macro Environment Impacts**
||The June 2024 data from The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) indicates a continued but slowing contraction in economic activity. The LEI's decline, driven by negative consumer sentiment, weak new orders, and increased unemployment claims, suggests that economic momentum is waning. According to the Taylor Rule, the Federal Reserve may need to consider these mixed signals when adjusting monetary policy. The slight improvement in the LEI's long-term growth trajectory points to a slow recovery, which could influence the Fed's decision to maintain or slightly adjust interest rates. The CEI's modest increase reflects current economic stability, while the LAG's slight rise suggests that past economic conditions are still exerting some influence. Overall, the data implies that the Federal Reserve should adopt a cautious approach, balancing between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth. The forecasted GDP growth of around 1% in Q3 2024 underscores the need for careful monitoring of economic indicators to inform policy adjustments.üçé||
